            <p>Happy Birthday, Nusha! I had written a message before but I think there are some things that are to be said. We have fought a lot lately and I am really sorry about that. While writing this message and adding our pictures together, it gave me a small trip of our relationship and out of all the things, I am just deeply in love with you. I let my emotions take over in certain situations and that’s on me. But I promise to keep in mind the way I fell in love with you and treat you the way you deserve. Now leaving the sad part, it’s your 21st birthday, WOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. This is my 3rd birthday of yours since I have known you. I really don’t know where the time has passed but keeping the ritual alive, gotta write you a paragraph. I know you don’t have expectations on your birthday, but I do want you to have it from me. I am not a great planner but I try something. God knows how you fell for me and my “that’s what she said” jokes but I am so lucky that you did. You really saved me from a lot of things and you should be grateful to exist and to have been born despite what your family tells you. I am really grateful for you and I love you so so so so so so much. Which is why I have made a college of picture that I believe expresses you the best and why I love you and that you exist. These are my 21 highlights of how I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUU</p>

            <p>Honestly I am really glad I have found you, I hope you can forgive me for my past mistakes and I am really proud of you for all the things you have achieved 
                and I hope you have a better year ahead altogether. Also dont worry this is not where it ends, there are some other things that are left to do offline. I have some surprises for you which you will only find out later. 
                I am so grateful for you and I love you so much.
